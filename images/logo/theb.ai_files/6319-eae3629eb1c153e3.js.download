The headset is manufactured by Luxshare and runs on an operating system called visionOS, which is based on iOS [\xb9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Vision_Pro).\n\nSome key features of the Apple Vision Pro include:\n\n1. Display: The headset features a high-resolution display system that packs 23 million pixels across two displays, which is more than a 4K TV for each eye [\xb3](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/06/introducing-apple-vision-pro/). The display is dual micro-OLED with an RGBB π subpixel geometry [\xb9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Vision_Pro).\n\n2. Input: The Apple Vision Pro utilizes 6DoF (six degrees of freedom) inside-out tracking, photogrammetry, and gesture recognition through 12 built-in cameras and LiDAR [\xb9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Vision_Pro).\n\n3. CPU: It is powered by the Apple M2 and R1 processors [\xb9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Vision_Pro).\n\n4.
